You may find your initial vertex point cloud is a little small - feel free to apply an image plane multiplier to scale the coordinates up so that they fit nicely into the drawing window. Make sure you scale x and y by the same amount (in order to maintain the aspect ratio of the point cloud).

You might also find (depending on how you write your code) that your render is flipped upside-down. Any ideas why this might be ? Any thoughts about how to fix this problem ?

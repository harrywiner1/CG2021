Write a new function called `interpolateThreeElementValues` that operates on three-element floating point values (rather than just single floats). These three-element floating point values should be instances of the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLSL_Programming/Vector_and_Matrix_Operations" target="_blank">vec3</a> class provided by GLM. If we have a function that can interpolate these, then we can deal with a wide range of entities including colours, 3D coordinates, directions (in fact anything with 3 numerical elements !)  

By way of example, if we have the following two `vec3` variables:
``` cpp
glm::vec3 from(1, 4, 9.2);
glm::vec3 to(4, 1, 9.8);
```
And pass them into our new interpolation function (along with a `numberOfValues` of 4), then we should get the following results back:

``` cpp
(1, 4, 9.2)
(2, 3, 9.4)
(3, 2, 9.6)
(4, 1, 9.8)
```

Write your function and then test it with the above values in order to check that it operates as intended.

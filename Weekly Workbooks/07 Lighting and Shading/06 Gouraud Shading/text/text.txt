Due to the fact that we represent models as a series of triangles, any artefacts within a model will have a finite resolution. When rendering a model (unless we have a huge number of triangles) the surfaces may well appear "blocky" and "low-res". But what if we could shade triangles more "intelligently" and blend their edges together ? That would "smooth off" the sharp corners and provide an apparently higher resolution final rendering !

_Gouraud shading_ in one such intelligent approach to surface shading. View the slides and audio narration above to gain an understanding of Gouraud shading. Using this knowledge, implement Gouraud shading in your renderer. In order to achieve this, you will need to make use of _Barycentric coordinates_ to interpolate vertex the brightnesses across the face of each triangle. The operation of Barycentric coordinates is illustrated in the animation at the top of this section.

The image below illustrates the smoothing effect of Gouraud shading - it is important to note that both spheres have the _same_ geometry (the same number of triangles). The surfaces in the sphere on the left are shaded with a flat colour, whereas the sphere on the right is rendered using Gouraud shading.

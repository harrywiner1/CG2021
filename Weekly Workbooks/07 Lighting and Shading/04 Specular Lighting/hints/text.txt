You should use a relatively large exponent in the calculation of specular spread (for example 256). This will ensure that you get a tightly focused spot/beam of light, which will be easier to see than a specular highlight with a wider spread. It can be difficult to distinguish between the various different lighting effects if the parameters used are too subtle !

You may need to move the light and/or camera to an appropriate location in the scene in order to be able to see the specular highlight effect. Remember that specular lighting represents the reflection of the light source, so the camera needs to be in a position where the reflection should be visible.

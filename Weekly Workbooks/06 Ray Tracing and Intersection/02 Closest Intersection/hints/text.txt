Your function is going to need to return various details about the intersection point found. There is a class in the libs/sdw folder called `RayTriangleIntersection` that you might like to use to store and return all of these details.

In order to help you test the correct operation of your function, use the following test case: a `cameraPosition` of `[0.0, 0.0, 4.0]` and a `rayDirection` of `[-0.1, -0.1, -2.0]` should result in a closest intersection distance `t` of approximately `1.979`. Note that this test case assumes you are using the standard Cornell Box model with a model scaling of `0.17` and that you haven't done anything strange when loading in the OBJ geometry data (i.e. not flipping or inverting of coordinates). If you function does agree with this result, then it _could_ still be correct (if you are storing or manipulating your model in an unusual way !)

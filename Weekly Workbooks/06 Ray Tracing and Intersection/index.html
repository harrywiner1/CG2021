<p>Rasterising is a fast and efficient approach to rendering a 3 dimensional scene. However, it has limitations it that there are a number of phenomena that are difficult (or impossible) to achieve using this approach. In particular, rendering “light” and “shadow” is not well suited to rasterising. For this reason, we now turn our attention to an alternative form of rendering: <em>ray tracing</em>. Take a look at the slides, audio narration and animation linked to above in order to gain a high-level understanding of the operation of <em>ray tracing</em>. Once you have grasped the basic principles, move on to the tasks in the remainder of this workbook.</p>
<p>It is advisable to continue working with your current project and augment it with additional ray tracing functions. This will not only allow you to switch between different rendering models (wireframe, rasterised, ray-traced) but will also permit “hybrid” rendering to take place (don’t worry what this means yet - we will discuss it in more detail later).</p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
The code that you will write in this workbook will be VERY resource intensive. If you find that your renderer is running too slowly to allow you to navigate the camera around the scene effectively, then you might like to try using the optimised <code>make speedy</code> build rule.</p>

<h3 id="task-2-closest-intersection">Task 2: Closest Intersection</h3>
<p><a href='02%20Closest%20Intersection/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/slides.png" /> </a> <a href='02%20Closest%20Intersection/audio/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/audio.png" /> </a> <a href='02%20Closest%20Intersection/audio/segment-2.mp4' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/audio.png" /> </a> <a href='02%20Closest%20Intersection/animation/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/animation.png" /> </a> <a href='02%20Closest%20Intersection/animation/segment-2.mp4' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/animation.png" /> </a></p>
<p>The first objective we need to achieve when attempting to perform ray tracing is to be able to detect when (and where) a projected ray intersects with a model triangle. Watch the narrated slides and animations above to gain a theoretical understanding of how to perform this operation.</p>
<p>With the knowledge gained, your task is to write a function called <code>getClosestIntersection</code> that take the position of the camera (as a <code>vec3</code>) and the direction of a ray being cast from the camera into the scene (also as a <code>vec3</code>). This function should search through the all the triangles in the current scene and return details of the <em>closest</em> intersected triangle (if indeed there is an intersection !).</p>
<p>We appreciate that this is a complex task, so to help you get started, the code below is the C++ equivalent of the ray/triangle intersection equation that was shown in the slides above:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a>glm::vec3 e0 = triangle.vertices[<span class="dv">1</span>] - triangle.vertices[<span class="dv">0</span>];</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a>glm::vec3 e1 = triangle.vertices[<span class="dv">2</span>] - triangle.vertices[<span class="dv">0</span>];</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3"></a>glm::vec3 SPVector = cameraPosition - triangle.vertices[<span class="dv">0</span>];</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4"></a>glm::mat3 DEMatrix(-rayDirection, e0, e1);</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5"></a>glm::vec3 possibleSolution = glm::inverse(DEMatrix) * SPVector;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Remember that the <code>possibleSolution</code> calculated by the above code is NOT the <code>(x,y,z)</code> coordinates of a point in 3 dimensional space, but rather a three-element data structure that consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>t</code> the <em>absolute</em> distance along the ray from the camera to the intersection point</li>
<li><code>u</code> the <em>proportional</em> distance along the triangle’s first edge that the intersection point occurs</li>
<li><code>v</code> the <em>proportional</em> distance along the triangle’s second edge that the intersection point occurs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
Your function is going to need to return various details about the intersection point found. There is a class in the libs/sdw folder called <code>RayTriangleIntersection</code> that you might like to use to store and return all of these details.</p>
<p>In order to help you test the correct operation of your function, use the following test case: a <code>cameraPosition</code> of <code>[0.0, 0.0, 4.0]</code> and a <code>rayDirection</code> of <code>[-0.1, -0.1, -2.0]</code> should result in a closest intersection distance <code>t</code> of approximately <code>1.979</code>. Note that this test case assumes you are using the standard Cornell Box model with a model scaling of <code>0.17</code> and that you haven’t done anything strange when loading in the OBJ geometry data (i.e. not flipping or inverting of coordinates). If you function does agree with this result, then it <em>could</em> still be correct (if you are storing or manipulating your model in an unusual way !)</p>
<h1 id="section-1"></h1>
<h3 id="task-3-validating-intersections">Task 3: Validating Intersections</h3>
<p><a href='03%20Validating%20Intersections/animation/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/animation.png" /> </a></p>
<p>We need to be careful when searching for ray/triangle intersections because the <code>getClosestIntersection</code> function can often return false-positive results. The reason for this is that formulae provided previously allow us to calculate the intersection between a line and a <em>plane</em>. We must however remember that the triangle is a discrete segment of that plane. The code that you wrote in the previous task will find solutions that are <em>on the same plane</em> as the triangle, but not actually <em>within the bounds</em> of the triangle itself (as illustrated by the X in the diagram below).</p>
<p>In order to solve this problem, we simply have to validate the coordinates of a potential intersection before we accept it as a solution. Watch the video linked to at the top of this task for an explanation of how this is achieved. Once you have grasped the basic principles, implement the validation check in your <code>getClosestIntersection</code> function so that it checks a possible solution to make sure that it is valid <em>before</em> returning it as an actual solution. To help you in this task, integrate the following three tests into your code:</p>
<pre><code>(u &gt;= 0.0) &amp;&amp; (u &lt;= 1.0)
(v &gt;= 0.0) &amp;&amp; (v &lt;= 1.0)
(u + v) &lt;= 1.0</code></pre>
<p>You should also check that the distance <code>t</code> from the camera to the intersection is positive - otherwise you may end up rendering triangles that are actually <em>behind</em> the camera !</p>
<p><img src="03%20Validating%20Intersections/images/outside-bounds.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
Test your <code>getClosestIntersection</code> function by passing it a direction vector with a <em>known</em> intersection (e.g. the ray that is fired through the dead centre of the image plane <em>should</em> intersect with the front of the blue box in the test model).</p>
<h1 id="section-2"></h1>
<h3 id="task-4-ray-tracing-the-scene">Task 4: Ray Tracing the Scene</h3>
<p><a href='04%20Ray%20Tracing%20the%20Scene/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/slides.png" /> </a> <a href='04%20Ray%20Tracing%20the%20Scene/audio/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/audio.png" /> </a></p>
<p>Now that you have a function that can identify the closest valid intersection of a single ray, we can use this in order to render an entire scene ! Write a new <code>draw</code> function that renders the Cornell Box model using Ray Tracing. Don’t throw away your old “rasterising” <code>draw</code> function - you are going to need this later. Instead you should rename it to something appropriate (such as <code>drawRasterisedScene</code>).</p>
<p>In your new <code>draw</code> method, loop through each pixel on the image plane (top-to-bottom, left-to-right), casting a ray from the camera, <em>through</em> the current pixel and into the scene. Using your previously written <code>getClosestIntersection</code> function, determine if the ray intersects with a triangle in the model. When a valid intersection has been identified, paint the image plane pixel with the colour of the closest intersected triangle.</p>
<p>Remember that in this task, you are converting <em>from</em> a canvas position <em>to</em> a direct/location in three dimensional space. As such you need to do the exact <em>opposite</em> of your previously written <code>getCanvasIntersectionPoint</code> function (where you down-projected a 3D vertex location into a 2D canvas position). For this reason, you need to do <strong>everything</strong> in <em>reverse</em>: subtracting when you previously added, dividing where you previously multiplied. The order which you applied the operations will also need to be reversed ! Clearly this is going to require a fair bit of thinking about !!!</p>
<p>When everything is working properly, you should end up with a render that looks similar to the one shown below.</p>
<p><img src="04%20Ray%20Tracing%20the%20Scene/images/basic-ray-tracing.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
At this stage, it probably doesn’t seem like you have made any progress - if anything, this is a <em>slower</em> way of getting the same results as with the rasteriser. In the following tasks however (and next week as well), we will be doing things that are either hard or impossible to do with a rasteriser - so stick with it, this is all going to be worth it !</p>
<h1 id="section-3"></h1>
<h3 id="task-5-casting-shadows">Task 5: Casting Shadows</h3>
<p><a href='05%20Casting%20Shadows/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/slides.png" /> </a> <a href='05%20Casting%20Shadows/audio/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/audio.png" /> </a></p>
<p>Shadows are a key element of 3D rendering that we have until this point not addressed. We see shadows all the time in the real world (just take a look around you now !). If we want our renders to look realistic, we are going to need to simulate them.</p>
<p>Determining whether or not a particular point on a surface should be drawn in shadow is conceptually relatively straight-forward. All we have to ask ourselves is: can that point “see” the light ? However, there are some additional complexities that we have to deal with when implementing a consistent shadow effect. Review the slides and audio narrative relating to shadows above and then implement the concepts in your Ray Tracer.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that your already-implemented <code>getClosestIntersection</code> function does a lot of the work required in order to check for the visibility of the light from a point on a surface. You may however need to invest a bit of time refactoring it to make it versatile enough to be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>Once you have implemented a shadow feature, your render of the Cornell box should look something a little bit like the image below (depending on where you position your light source !). Note that your shadow may well look a little bit “speckly” and you might have shadows appearing where you wouldn’t expect to see them. Don’t worry - this is all to be expected - we will fix this in the following task !</p>
<p><img src="05%20Casting%20Shadows/images/without-ambient.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
You are going to need a new <code>vec3</code> variable to hold the position of a single-point light source. A location in the middle of the room, above the origin, somewhere near the ceiling would seem sensible place for it (e.g. <code>[0.0, 0.75, 0.0]</code>)</p>
<h1 id="section-4"></h1>
<h3 id="task-6-shadow-acne">Task 6: Shadow Acne</h3>
<p><a href='06%20Shadow%20Acne/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/slides.png" /> </a> <a href='06%20Shadow%20Acne/audio/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> <img src="../../resources/icons/audio.png" /> </a></p>
<p>When implementing your shadow you will probably notice that is has a “speckled” appearance and spills out of the area where they shadow should appear (as illustrated in the image below). This effect is known as “shadow acne” and it a commonly encountered phenomenon in ray traced shadows. View the slides and audio narration linked to above for a discussion of the cause of this effect and an explanation of one solution to this problem. Once you have gained this understanding, add some additional code to your project to remove this phenomenon from your render.</p>
<p><img src="06%20Shadow%20Acne/images/center.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
If you need to compare two triangles for equality, make sure you use their <strong>index</strong> values as the basis for comparison (i.e. their positions in the triangle array). If you try to compare two instances of the <code>ModelTriangle</code> class using the <code>==</code> operator, you may inadvertently be testing the memory address of those variables, rather than checking to see if those two variables actually hold the same triangle !</p>
<p>To support this, the <code>RayTriangleIntersection</code> class has an attribute called <code>triangleIndex</code> that can be used to store the index number of a triangle being intersected. Note that you’ll have to fill this attribute yourself with a suitable value when your <code>getClosestIntersection</code> function detects a valid intersection.</p>
<h1 id="section-5"></h1>
<h3 id="task-7-interactive-renderer-switching">Task 7: Interactive Renderer Switching</h3>
<p>As a final task in this workbook, add some additional key event handlers to your program that allows the user to interactively switch between the three main modes of rendering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wireframe: Stroked/Outline triangles</li>
<li>Rasterised: Filled Triangles drawn using your rasterising code</li>
<li>Ray Traced: Filled Triangles drawn using your brand-new raytracing code</li>
</ul>
<p>This will prove very useful later on in the unit for interactive testing: it will allow you to navigate the camera around the scene using the FAST wireframe or rasterised renderers. Then, once the camera is in the desired position, you can switch to the (much slower) Ray Traced renderer to view the fully lit scene from the current position.</p>

There is an issue with the basic texture mapping approach that we used in the rasteriser workbook. The problem is that it doesn't take into account the effect of perspective. This is illustrated in the image below - the left hand side shows the a naive (non-corrected) texture and the right hand side shows the perspective corrected version of the same texture. You should be able to see that the left hand image is clearly not right. Review the slides and audio narration to gain an understanding of the nature of the problem and how we might go about solving it.

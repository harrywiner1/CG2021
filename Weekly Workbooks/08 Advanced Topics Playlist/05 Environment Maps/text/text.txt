The problem with rendering mirrored surfaces is that they reflect everything that surrounds them ! This can make rendering complex scenes particularly costly. We can however use flat images in the form of "Environment Maps" to capture a view of the surrounding area from the perspective of a 3D object. Because these maps are flat images (rather than 3D models in their own right) this can make the computation of reflections much more efficient.

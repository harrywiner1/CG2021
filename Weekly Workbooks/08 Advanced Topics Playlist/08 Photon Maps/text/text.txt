Previously we used ambient lighting as an approximation to global illumination. However, this is a very big approximation that prevents us from rendering certain types of specialist lighting effects. _Photon maps_ offer a more sophisticated approach that allow us to precompute patterns of light dispersal in order to (relatively) efficiently render more realistic indirect illumination. Take a look at the slides, narration and animation to gain an insight into this technique.

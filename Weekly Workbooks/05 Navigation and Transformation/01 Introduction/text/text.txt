This workbook continues from where we left off last week, by implementing additional features for the rasterising renderer. We start by adding texture mapping to the existing flat-colour renderer. Following on from that, we make the whole thing interactive (so that the user can navigate the camera around the model). If you didn't complete all of tasks from last week, you should finish these first before starting on this week's workbook.

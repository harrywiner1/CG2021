When testing your filled triangle drawing code, watch out for "skipped" lines (as illustrated in the orange triangle below). These skipped lines are due to floating point values being truncated ("chopped off") when they are converted into integer screen coordinates. When converting from floats to ints you should be sure to round to the _nearest_ whole number !

Just in case you need it: you might like to use the standard C <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/utility/swap/" target="_blank">std::swap</a> function if you need to do any sorting ;o)
